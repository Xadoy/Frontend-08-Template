学习笔记

- Javascript RegExp

  - `RegExp` objects are stateful when they have `global`or `sticky` flags set (`/g`or `/y`). Using this to iterate over multiple matches in a string of text.
  - or we could simply use string.matchAll(regexp), which will return an iterator.

- Generator & Iterator

  - Generator composition -> yield* in function*
  - Yield as a two-way commnucation channel
    -> let arg = yield xxx; usage: gen.next().value; gen.next(arg);
  - async generators -> <to_read>

- Lexical
  - Non Terminal Symbol:
    A symbol or token is called non terminal when it does not appear in the resulting formal language. They are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated by the non-terminal symbols.
